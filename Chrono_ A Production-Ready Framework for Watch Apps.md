# Chrono: A Production-Ready Framework for Watch Apps

Chrono is a new, ambitious framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of high-performance, truly cross-platform applications for smartwatches. Our goal is to provide a seamless developer experience, enabling you to write a single codebase that compiles natively for both watchOS (Apple Watch) and Wear OS (Android watches), without compromising on performance or native feel.

## Vision

Chrono aims to solve the biggest pain points in watch app development:

1.  **True Cross-Platform Development:** Write once, deploy to both watchOS and Wear OS natively.
2.  **Performance by Default:** Optimized for resource-constrained watch environments.
3.  **Developer Experience:** Fast, easy, and enjoyable development, testing, and deployment.
4.  **Seamless Phone-to-Watch Communication:** A unified, simple API for data synchronization and messaging.
5.  **Integration with Existing Ecosystems:** Easily connect with mobile apps built in React Native, Flutter, or native iOS/Android.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **Core Architecture:** TypeScript-based, compiled directly to native ARM machine code for optimal performance.
*   **Declarative UI:** A component-based approach for building UIs, similar to React or Flutter.
*   **Unified Component Library:** A single set of UI components that map to native elements on each platform.
*   **Chrono Connect API:** Robust and simple API for phone-to-watch communication, with SDKs for React Native, Flutter, and native mobile apps.
*   **Power-Aware APIs:** Built-in optimizations for battery life and efficient resource usage.
*   **Chrono Forge Dev Tools:** Comprehensive tooling including CLI, IDE integration, simultaneous emulators, hot reload, and power profiler.
*   **Comprehensive Hardware APIs:** Access to health data, location, haptics, and more.
